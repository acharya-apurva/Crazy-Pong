# Crazy-Pong

This is a slighly varied version of the classic 2 player pong game. In the game, the paddles are allowed to move to right and left directions in addition to the up
and down directions that the classic pong game already allows. This added functionality makes for a more fun and intense gameplay.
The game is made using C++ and the RayLib library. It is made on Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 and is compiled using Microsoft's Visual C++ compiler.
